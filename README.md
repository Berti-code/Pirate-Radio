# Pirate-Radio
Using this project you could create your own FM radio station, and it's as simple as connecting an analog antenna and runing the FM
transmitter script provided [here](https://github.com/somu1795/fm_transmitter).

You could also check out Make magazine's script [here](https://github.com/Make-Magazine/PirateRadio).They also have an image for this.
<p>I used an analog antenna from a portable TV for this project, but a simple wire would also do the job.</p>
